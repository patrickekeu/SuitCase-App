# SuitCase-App
An Android Mobile Development application I created in Fall 2023 using Android Studio and Google Material Design coding with Java and Kotlin.

# Scenario
SuitCase

You have been commissioned to create an app that will help people plan for a holiday by allowing them to make a list of things they need to buy. This app will store a list of items they need, as well as a description, price and picture of the item. Extra features will allow optional location tracking of the shop they need to visit as well as item delegation. 

Typical user interactions:

Louise has just booked a holiday for herself and her family. She wants an app that will help her prepare and ensure she has everything they need for their getaway. She searches for holiday planning apps on the play store and finds SuitCase. She downloads this app, registers an account and logs in. Inside this app she starts to list all of the things she needs for her upcoming holiday. As she has a supportive family, she is not buying all of these things herself. After adding a few items to her list, she delegates one of these items to her Husband. The app sends him an SMS text message with the name of the item, price and a description. There is also an option to tag a location of where he can buy the item from. Louise also has the ability to maintain her list with edit and delete options for each item as well as being able to add each item to a purchased list. 

A few days later, Louise is browsing different shopping apps such as eBay and Amazon for things she might need. She notices that she can now share products from these apps directly to her SuitCase app so she decided to do this with a bottle of sun cream. The SuitCase app handles this request and prefills in the URL of the product she wants to buy, leaving her to complete the remaining fields.

You are required to develop a prototype application for the Android operating systems which will include at least all of the core requirements. 


# The Prototype
Core requirements of the app:
Home screen - the point of entry for your app.
User registration and login.
Manage my items
Delete items
Edit items
Mark as purchased
Create an item
Item Delegation
The ability to send an item as an SMS to another phone / contact. 

Optional Desirable Requirements for the app:
The ability to Geotag an item so the location of the item can be recorded and then viewed on a map.
The ability to allow integration with other apps so products from other apps can be stored on the SuitCase app.
To include appropriate gesture controls to improve the management of items. As a minimum this would include swipe left and right and shake. 

There is no associated logo or house style for this app yet so you have free reign over the appearance, but pay particular attention to Material Design.
